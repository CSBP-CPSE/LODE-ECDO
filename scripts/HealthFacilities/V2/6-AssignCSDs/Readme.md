### Census subdivisions ((CSD))

Census subdivisions are a way to divide the whole of Canadian territory and are usually based on municipalities. Each CSD has a unique identifier.

In Assign_CSDs.py, the script takes the longitudes and latitudes of every location and with the shapefile for CSD, the program determines within which CSD each lat/long is located. 

The assigned_CSDs.csv contains the CSD name, CSD ID and province ID for each location
