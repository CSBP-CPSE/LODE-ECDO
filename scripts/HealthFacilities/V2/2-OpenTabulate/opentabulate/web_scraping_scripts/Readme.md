Welcome to the web scraping scripts folder!

Here, you can find all the Python scripts used to webscrape 10 different websites. Most scripts have comments detailing how they work, but for a real in depth explanation of most of the coding techniques used throughout all scripts, read through 'SK_Health_Facilities' and especially 'MB_Northern_Health'

The output of every script is sent to the data/output and the data/web_scraped folders. (output to be merged with the rest of the data and web_scraped to keep a clean record of these datasets)

AB_hospital_services is not exactly a webscraping script. The information in the CSV file was taken from a PDF file, with the help of Word and Excel. The python notebook attached to it is there to split the "info" column into multiple other columns
